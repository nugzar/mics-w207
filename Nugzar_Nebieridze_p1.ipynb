While sklearn can handle real-valued features, let's start by mapping the pixel values to either 0 or 1. You can do this as a preprocessing step, or with the binarize argument. With binary-valued features, you can use BernoulliNB. Next try mapping the pixel values to 0, 1, or 2, representing white, grey, or black. This mapping requires MultinomialNB.
